Dodge the car

You are controlling a car using the joystick, and random cars are coming from the top and you have to dodge them.
Your score increments based on seconds survived and based on the level you are in, higher levels give more points.
At higher levels the cars move faster and the space between each of them decrements until you only have one windows to dodge perfectly.
You will have 2 or 3 lives, as well as a Super that will activate by using the joystick button and it will make you invincible for a short duration.
Highscore can be saved and shown on the LCD alongisde the current score.
