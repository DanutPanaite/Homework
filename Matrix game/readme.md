<h1>RUSH HOUR</h1>
<h2>HOW TO PLAY </h2>
 In Rush Hour, you are controlling a car using the joystick and your purpose is to rack up points by dodging the cars that will come your
way from the top of the screen. Moving the joystick sideways(left to right or right to left) will change lanes, and on the Y-axis(up and
down) the car will go up towards the other cars. You have thwee lives and three super powers at your disposal, the three supers can be
activated using the joystick button and they will grant you invincibility for a short time.  <br>
