This project contains a 4 digit 7-Segment display and a joystick. The display will show a 4 digit number, each digit being chosen independently
by the user using the joystick. The X axis chooses the digit ( e.g the first digit, fourth etc), we will use the built in button of the 
joystick to choose the current digit to modify it. We will increment/decrement the digit by using the Y axis input, during this time
we are unable to move left or right with the X input, after we are done we will press the button again to return to choosing another digit.
The whole number is blinking rapidly when we are choosing a digit and the decimal point is lit up next to the digit we are on so we can better
undestand what input the program expects from us.
